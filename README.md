# Screen Capture
Extension available in the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-capture/ghihpjhpgdepnohngpgfcmcijmkggpaf).

It lets users capture the visible content of a tab, a region of a web page, or
the whole page as a PNG or JPEG image.

It is a fork of the Screen Capture (by Google) open-source extension, maintained
by [@avm99963](https://www.avm99963.com). The original extension is no longer
maintained by Google.
